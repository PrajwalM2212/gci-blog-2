In this task I had to make a pipfile template for pipenv support. This is better as users will run the versions of dependencies the developers of upstream support.

I originally didn't add the dev-packages section, which was brought to notice via issue #58 later. I added it later (PR #62) along with an easier way to define the packages, directly in the YAML file.
