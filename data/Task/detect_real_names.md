In this task, I had to enforce a check if the username provided is not a real name, as using full real names for usernames is not a good idea.

This was essentially a NLP task, so I had to lookup about NLTK which was new to me! So a new toolkit in my box. Made a python script

And then I had to integrate it with the project, so some JavaScript and Jinja2 trickery took place.
