In this high dificulty task, I had to create a factory function for the IGitt project. It took me 8 days.

I initially made very shameless noob mistakes considering which I was told about the task was hard to rescue, and then proceeded to realize it on day 2 and due to academics had to skip day 3.

Then I made the function along with another which would pass tokens (I thought I have to create tokens), but when reviewed I was told a readymade token object would be passed! I had to shorten my code and the resulting factory was good to go.

Next I have to make tests, and the tests were failing. Then the rest of the days I spent writing tests and fixing it along with mentor. One cassette recorded error and it was outputing it again and again (LOL trolled), there are three different independent versions of `giturlparse`, and app ID was invalid.

In the end tests passed and the task was approved.
