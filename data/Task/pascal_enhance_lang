In this another task about coAST, I added data types for Pascal.

I didn't intend to do this initially and thought about abstracting the repo more, which was suggested earlier in Zulip.

I intially did something else than Pascal data types, from which I added some extra things unrelated to Pascal after recovering them from backup, for which I made an issue for recovered commit and PR.

I lost my data as my Windows PC got berserk. Had to do a clean install.
